**Questions**

 1. Has the development of a country over time lead to better drinking water and sanitation?
 2. Does a country having basic drinking water services mean they also have basic sanitation services?
 3. Is it possible for a developed country to not have basic drinking water and/or sanitation, and vice versa?

**Abstract Tasks**

 1. Find correlation between country's wealth and access to safe drinking water and sanitation. I would need to browse the data to be able to identify a dependency to be able to present the answer.
 2. Compare a country's access of basic drinking water to basic sanitation services. I would need to browse the data to be able to identiy a correlation to be able to present the answer.
 3. Identify developed countries with sub-par access to basic drinking water and/or sanitation. I would need to browse the data to be able to identify the outliers where a developed country cannot supply access to basic drinking water and/or sanitation.
